/***
 * 
 * A bunch of people are living on an island, when a visitor comes with 
 * a strange order: all blue-eyed people must leave the island as soon 
 * as possible. There will be a flight out at 8:00pm every evening. 
 * Each person can seeeveryone else's eye color, but they do not know 
 * their own (nor is anyone allowed to tell them). Additionally, they 
 * do not know how many people have blue eyes, a/though they do know
 *  that at least one person does. How many days will it take the blue-eyed 
 *  people to leave?

 * EDIT: The answer is nice - couldn't figure it out at first - had to look.
 * If the island has n people and m blue-eye people, it will take m days.
